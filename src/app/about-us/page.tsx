About Me</h1>
<p >

I am a dedicated and results-driven web developer with a passion for building innovative, user-centric digital experiences. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in front-end development, specializing in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript to create responsive and interactive websites. </p>
<p>My experience spans across various projects, from simple static sites to complex web applications, where I focus on performance optimization and delivering seamless user interfaces.</p>
<p>With a keen eye for design and functionality, I always aim to balance aesthetics with practicality. 
</p>
<p>I enjoy bringing creative concepts to life and ensuring that every element serves a purpose.</p>
<p> My recent work includes building dynamic, editable, and shareable resume builders, crafting interactive web pages, and enhancing the user experience through smooth animations and interactivity.</p>
<p>
I thrive on learning new technologies and staying updated with the latest industry trends. 
</p>
<p>
Collaborating on projects that challenge my skills and allow me to innovate excites me, and I’m always looking for opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge in full-stack development.</p>
<p>
When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new design ideas, solving complex problems, and contributing to open-source projects. I’m committed to delivering high-quality, efficient, and impactful solutions for every client I work with.
